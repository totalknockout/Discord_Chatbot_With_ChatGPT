# Discord_Chatbot_With_ChatGPT
This repository provides a simple implementation of a chatbot that can engage in human-like conversations using the state-of-the-art language model, ChatGPT. With just a few lines of code, you can integrate the chatbot into your own projects or applications.


# Installation
To use this chatbot, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You will also need to have a Discord bot token and a ChatGPT API key.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
3. Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project and add the following lines to it:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your Discord bot token>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your ChatGPT API key>
```
Replace <your Discord bot token> with your actual Discord bot token, and <your ChatGPT API key> with your actual ChatGPT API key.

# Usage
  
To run the chatbot, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```
python bot.py
```
  
The chatbot will then connect to your Discord server and start listening for commands. You can send commands to the chatbot by typing !chatbot followed by your message in any text channel where the chatbot is present.

# Customization

You can customize the chatbot by modifying the bot.py file. For example, you can change the prefix used for commands, or add additional functionality to the chatbot.
